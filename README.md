## Installation

We provide two installation methods. Method 2 (using uv) is recommended for faster installation and better dependency management.

1. Install uv (A fast Python package installer and resolver):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# Or on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Browser Automation Tool (Optional)
```bash
playwright install
```

## Configuration

OpenManus requires configuration for the LLM APIs it uses. Follow these steps to set up your configuration:

1. Create a `config.toml` file in the `config` directory (you can copy from the example):

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2. Edit `config/config.toml` to add your API keys and customize settings:

```toml
# Global LLM configuration
[llm]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

# Optional configuration for specific LLM models
[llm.vision]
model = "gpt-4o"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key
```

## Quick Start

One line for run OpenManus:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then input your idea via terminal!

For MCP tool version, you can run:
```bash
python run_mcp.py
```

For unstable multi-agent version, you also can run:

```bash
python run_flow.py
```

### Custom Adding Multiple Agents

Currently, besides the general OpenManus Agent, we have also integrated the DataAnalysis Agent, which is suitable for data analysis and data visualization tasks. You can add this agent to `run_flow` in `config.toml`.

```toml
# Optional configuration for run-flow
[runflow]
use_data_analysis_agent = true     # Disabled by default, change to true to activate
```
In addition, you need to install the relevant dependencies to ensure the agent runs properly: [Detailed Installation Guide](app/tool/chart_visualization/README.md##Installation)
